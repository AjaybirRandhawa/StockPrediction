# Stock Prediction
Uses tensorflow 1.5 to predict stock market prices with a certain set accuracy. Do not use to buy stocks. Was purely used as experimental topic for learning Tensorflow and CNN's.
Any csv file may be uploaded, for best result the file must contain 1 year of data, the testing has been set to the last 30 days. Changing cell 2's csv file name is also extremely important. Feel free to build upon it as nessecary.
